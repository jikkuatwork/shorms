# Bootstrap Chain

- this is a repo thats partially complete
- it has a form builder
- we want to build it to a SurveyJS lite
- we have a plan in koder/plans/01_shorms-initial.md
- review the repo, the plan and give me a clear summary of what you understood
  before starting/resuming the work

## Files

- root of the repo has the code
- koder is a meta folder to guide dev
- koder/plans have plans
- koder/NEXT_SESSION.md has immediate next steps
- CLAUDE.md is symlinked to GEMINI.md, has quick to remember instructions
- CHANGELOG.md maintains changes in standard format

## Meta

- starting with koder/start.md, a Bootstrap Chain is created to provide LLM
  agent context to start the dev process

## Session Close Routine

- ONLY START THIS ROUTINE IF EXPLICTLY ASKED TO
- clean up files
- update Bootstrap Chain
- update docs (README/CHANGELOG/CLAUDE/ koder/NEXT_SESSION)
- prepare to restart the session

### Rationale

- its best to restart the session often
- llms lose quality as context goes up
